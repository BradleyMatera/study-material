## Day 1
- Bootstrap repo, workspace settings, and GitHub Pages.
- Type tokenizer text-segment logic from scratch twice.
- Refresh stack/queue/map helpers.

## Day 2
- Re-type attribute scanner + tag classification.
- Build parser stack with validation.
- Add malformed + nested test cases.

## Day 3
- Implement transform: break â†’ ms, emphasis/prosody flags, text aggregation.
- Run a 90-minute mock including one DSA warm-up.
- Update README with new observations.

## Day 4
- Review notes only; avoid writing code.
- Verify tooling (runtime, git auth, camera/screen share).
- During assessment: read prompt, outline, ship incremental commits, document assumptions.
